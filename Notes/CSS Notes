This will be where I put my CSS notes. Not sure how I will structure it,
but I want to make sure I have a go-to for this sort of thing. My main
issue (thus far), is tying the style sheet to HTML (not the act of it).
I know how to do it:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="insert link/name to stylesheet here">

But actually styling the page and using it to make a good looking page
is lost on me.
