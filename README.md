# Portfolio
Trying to make a web-based portfolio for myself.

As of 4/5/2024, I am still learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I'm hoping to expand my skills from front-end to back-end as well.

Plan as of now:

Continue learning the basics, making small projects utilizing frameworks like Angular.

Once I get the front-end (or am comfortable with it), I plan on moving to the back-end.

As of 4/10/24, I am working through a tutorial in BootStrap. Once I finish it, I want to make a mock portfolio, just to get a feel of how it goes. Once I finish, I want to work through Angular, followed by React. I think I will make my portfolio using one of these frameworks, then I will try to create diferent websites with the other 2 frameworks.
