# Portfolio
Trying to make a web-based portfolio for myself.

As of 4/5/2024, I am still learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I'm hoping to expand my skills from front-end to back-end as well.

Plan as of now:

Continue learning the basics, making small projects utilizing frameworks like Angular.

Once I get the front-end (or am comfortable with it), I plan on moving to the back-end.
